  <main>
    <p>I'm a real website with HTML markup and everything! No app framework was used to develop this website.</p>
    <p>If JavaScript fails to load, I'm still a working website! And if JavaScript loads, you've also got a button rendered by React.</p>
    <p>When you click the button, it will calculate the sum of two numbers using a function from our library.</p>
